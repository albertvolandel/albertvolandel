- 👋 Hi, I’m @albertvolandel
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code in arduino for my school project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to measure CO2 with arduino
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the code for the code to measure Co2 with an arduino mega 2560 and the captor :" CO2 MH-Z163
- I met seveals problems as I'm either unable to download the program or 
(if a use the program from the company tha delivered te captor) it always return me te same value of Co2 ppm which is not normal.
I do not understand where the problem is: can you help me? 
Thanks in advance.
